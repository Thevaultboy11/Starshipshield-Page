<h1 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">How To Protect Against XSS?</h1>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Introduction</h1>


<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
In the world of web development, security is paramount. One of the most common security vulnerabilities that web applications face today is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end user.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Understanding XSS and Sanitization</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
<strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong> is a type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. The attacker uses the web application as a conduit to deliver the malicious script to an unsuspecting user's browser. The script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
<strong>Sanitization</strong> is the process of cleaning or purifying your input data. The aim is to prevent any parts of the input from being interpreted in an unintended way. In the context of XSS, sanitization often involves removing or escaping characters that have special meanings in HTML and JavaScript.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">The Solution: Sanitizing User Input</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
To protect against XSS attacks, it's crucial to sanitize user input. <br>Here's a simple example in JavaScript:
</p>


```javascript
function sanitizeInput(text) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.appendChild(document.createTextNode(text));
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
This function creates a new text node containing the user input, which automatically escapes any HTML tags. The sanitized text is then returned.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Conclusion</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
In conclusion, sanitizing user input is a critical step in protecting your web application from XSS vulnerabilities. By understanding the nature of XSS attacks and the importance of sanitization, developers can create safer web applications.

Remember, in the world of web development, security should never be an afterthought!
