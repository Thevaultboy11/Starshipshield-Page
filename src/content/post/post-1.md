## The $81 Million Heist

Research and statistics show scary numbers on how much customer data gets leaked from companies. We will be surprised when we hear about the largest bank heist in history, the Bangladesh Bank breach, when they lost **$81 million!**

The scary fact is that they not only lost money due to the massive breach and how it was executed but also suffered damage to their reputation. They are no longer trusted, leading to potential future losses exceeding $81 million. Would you store your money in a breached bank?

> Note: The hackers executed the attack using email attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office.

## Teenagers Hacking Uber

Maybe that is not enough. But what about big companies like Uber when teenage hackers breached their data?

The hacker did his reconnaissance, found a sysadmin’s phone number, and flooded the victim with MFA push requests in the middle of the night until the targeted Uber employee accepted them.

The breach had financial implications for Uber. It not only incurred costs related to investigating and addressing the breach but also faced potential fines and legal settlements. Moreover, the drop in user engagement and tarnished reputation could have affected its business performance and valuation.

## What Do These Attacks Have in Common?

Now let us take a deep breath and go deep into these incidents. We will notice:

In the bank data breach...

- The network of the bank was not separated (if one network gets hacked, the rest will be).
- Hackers can easily break it and redirect millions to their own private accounts.
- Microsoft’s security bulletins had already addressed the risks of this vulnerability.

In the Uber data breach...

- Lax governance on admin credentials and MFA management.
- The original employee was vished—a type of targeted spear phishing.

From vulnerable firewall technology and insecure software in use to social engineering, the right penetration testing solution could have discovered these risks proactively!
